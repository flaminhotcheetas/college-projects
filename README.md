# Disaster Management Web Application

 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing a web-based Disaster Management system to efficiently store, manage, and update disaster-related information. The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform core database operations and supports real-time data handling for disaster preparedness and response.
The system is built using a Flask backend with a relational database and a dynamic frontend to enable seamless interaction between users and stored data.


 Objectives
- To design a responsive and interactive disaster management webpage  
- To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on disaster-related data  
- To integrate a backend server with a database for persistent data storage  
- To demonstrate full-stack web development concepts using Flask and SQL  

Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Flask (Python)  
- Database: SQL  
- Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub  

Features
- Add new disaster-related records to the database  
- View and retrieve stored disaster information  
- Update existing records through the web interface  
- Delete records when they are no longer required  
- Seamless integration between frontend and backend using Flask routes  


 CRUD Operations Implemented
- Create: Insert new disaster records  
- Read: Fetch and display existing records  
- Update: Modify stored disaster information  
- Delete: Remove outdated or incorrect records  



How to Run the Project:

--- **Ensure the database file is present in the project directory before running the application.** ---

1. Clone the repository:  ```bash
                          git clone <repository_url>
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:  cd disaster_perp

3. Install required dependencies:  pip install flask

4. Run the Flask application:  python app.py

5. Open your web browser and visit:  http://127.0.0.1:5000/


The web application will start running locally, allowing users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through the webpage with :   python filename.py
